# Git Workflow

## Utility Scripts

Scripts in `scripts/` handle complex git/gh operations that are error-prone to reproduce inline. Execute them directly with `python3` — do not regenerate their logic inline. All scripts are stdlib-only Python.

Scripts are referenced by relative paths under `scripts/`. If that doesn't resolve (e.g. working from a worktree or different directory), the scripts are bundled alongside this skill file. Use its parent directory to construct the absolute path.

All GitHub interactions use the `gh` CLI exclusively (no MCP tools for git/GitHub operations).

| Script                                                                                        | Purpose                                                                   |

| `scripts/gather_repo_state.py`                                                                | Repo state JSON: owner, repo, branch, base, staged, commits ahead         |
| `scripts/fetch_pr_context.py <owner> <repo> <N> [--max-lines] [--max-file-lines] [--no-skip]` | PR metadata + filtered per-file diffs as JSON                             |
| `scripts/fetch_threads.py <owner> <repo> <N>`                                                 | Fetch unresolved PR threads (paginated GraphQL)                           |
| `scripts/submit_review.py <owner> <repo> <N> <event> <summary> [comments.json]`               | Submit review with optional line comments                                 |
| `scripts/create_worktree.py <branch> [base]`                                                  | Create worktree in `$GIT_WORKTREE_DIR` with `<repo>-<branch-slug>` naming |
| `scripts/validate_commit_msg.py <msg>`                                                        | Validate conventional commit + 50/72 rules                                |

## Preflight

- Confirm you are inside the target git repository and `origin` exists.
- Confirm `gh auth status` succeeds before any GitHub operation.
- Confirm whether staged changes on the current branch should be included before creating a PR.
- Confirm `$GIT_WORKTREE_DIR` is set before creating a worktree.

## Common Failure Cases

- `gather_repo_state.py` exits non-zero for detached HEAD or missing `origin`.
- `create_worktree.py` exits non-zero if the branch already exists or the target worktree directory already exists.
- `validate_commit_msg.py` returns JSON errors for invalid conventional commits or 50/72 violations.
- PR and review scripts fail if `gh` is not authenticated or the repo is not accessible.

## Worktrees

```bash
python3 scripts/create_worktree.py <branch-name> [base-ref]
```

- Requires `$GIT_WORKTREE_DIR` to be set in the shell environment
- Creates the base directory if it doesn't exist
- Validates branch doesn't already exist locally or on remote
- Directory naming: `<repo>-<branch-slug>` (`widget` + `feat/add-auth` -> `widget-feat-add-auth`)

## Conventions Quick Reference

Full specification in [conventions.md](conventions.md).

**Branch**: `<type>/<description>` — lowercase alphanumerics and hyphens only

**Commit**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>` — imperative mood, max 50 char subject

**PR title**: Same as commit format, description lowercase after prefix

| Type     | Branch Prefix | Commit Prefix |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Feature  | `feat/`       | `feat:`       |
| Bug fix  | `fix/`        | `fix:`        |
| Hotfix   | `hotfix/`     | `fix:`        |
| Release  | `release/`    | `chore:`      |
| Chore    | `chore/`      | `chore:`      |
| Docs     | `docs/`       | `docs:`       |
| Refactor | `refactor/`   | `refactor:`   |
| Test     | `test/`       | `test:`       |
| CI       | `ci/`         | `ci:`         |
| Build    | `build/`      | `build:`      |
| Perf     | `perf/`       | `perf:`       |
| Style    | `style/`      | `style:`      |

## Branch Creation

1. Analyze staged/unstaged changes (or ask for context if ambiguous)
2. Generate: `git checkout -b <type>/<description>`
3. Rules: lowercase, hyphens between words, no consecutive/leading/trailing hyphens

## Commits

1. Run `git diff --staged`. If nothing is staged, ask the user what to stage (or `git add` specific files based on context) before proceeding.
2. If intent unclear, ask for task description
3. Generate two options — concise and detailed:

```bash
git commit -m "<type>[scope]: <description>"

git commit -m "<type>[scope]: <description>" -m "<body explaining what and why>"
```

4. Validate before committing:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_commit_msg.py "<message>"
```

For multi-line messages (body/footer), write to a temp file under `$TMPDIR` and use `--file`:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_commit_msg.py --file "$TMPDIR/commit-msg.txt"
```

Returns `{"valid": true/false, "errors": [...]}`. Fix any errors before executing the commit.

### 50/72 Rule

- **Subject**: max 50 chars, imperative mood, no trailing period, lowercase after prefix
- **Body**: wrap at 72 chars, explain WHAT and WHY (not HOW), separate from subject with blank line
- **Footer**: `Closes #123`, `BREAKING CHANGE: ...`

### Breaking Changes

Indicate with `!` after type/scope (`feat!:`, `feat(api)!:`) or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

## PR Creation

1. Gather repo state, create branch/commit if needed.
2. If the current branch already has commits ahead of base and also has staged changes, do not ignore the staged work. Ask whether it belongs in the PR; if yes, commit it first.
3. Generate PR title from commit/branch following conventions.
4. **MANDATORY**: Locate and fill the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (check repo root `.github/` first, then skill-bundled template).
5. **NEVER** use the commit message as the PR body. Always fill all relevant sections of the template based on the changes.
6. Push and create the PR using `gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<body>"`.

Full procedure in [pr-operations.md](pr-operations.md).

## PR Review

1. **Fetch Context**: Use `python3 scripts/fetch_pr_context.py <owner> <repo> <number>` to get metadata and diffs.
2. **Determine Focus**: Default to comprehensive (Correctness, Security, etc.) unless overridden by user.
3. **Analyze**: Review diffs against focus areas; skip noisy/generated files automatically.
4. **Build Review**: Draft summary and line comments (prefixed with `[critical]`, `[suggestion]`, or `[nit]`).
5. **Confirm & Submit**: Present the full review to the user for confirmation before submitting via `python3 scripts/submit_review.py`.

Full procedure in [pr-operations.md](pr-operations.md).

## Address PR Comments

1. **Fetch Threads**: Use `python3 scripts/fetch_threads.py <owner> <repo> <number>` to get unresolved, non-outdated threads.
2. **Checkout & Fix**: Switch to the PR branch and implement minimal changes addressing feedback.
3. **Commit & Push**: Group related fixes into logical commits; validate messages before pushing.
4. **Reply**: Post descriptive replies to each thread using `gh api` only after a successful push.
